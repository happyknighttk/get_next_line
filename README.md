# get_next_line
In this 42 Istanbul project, I learned the concept of static variables. The function here gets me one line at a time from the file that is read. Also, it is completely leak free. The get_next_line() function is given a file descriptor which is read by the helper functions and added to the static variable. It works with any count of BUFFER_SIZE. It can also read from standart input. If you want to read from multiple file descriptors you should use the bonus part files. It uses a two dimensional array for the static variable and it keeps the file descriptors separately.
